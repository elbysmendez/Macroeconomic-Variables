Hi, I’m @elbysmendez
I’m an economist working as an investor consultant and tourism projects valuation. 
I'm currently interested in learning python as a data analysis tool. This repository (still in progress) contains data and plots about the macroeconomic environment in the Dominican Republic. The goal is to later integrate them in a single dashboard using the react.js
